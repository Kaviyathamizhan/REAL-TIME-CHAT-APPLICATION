# REAL-TIME CHAT-APPLICATION

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: KAVIYATHAMIZHAN T K

INTERN ID: CT08WC44

DOMAIN: MERN STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 8 WEEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:

This project is a real-time chat application developed using React for the frontend and Socket.IO for real-time bi-directional communication between clients and the server. It allows users to join a chat room with a chosen username and exchange instant messages with others connected to the same server. The application is lightweight, responsive, and includes a user-friendly interface with visual distinctions between sender and receiver messages.

Key Technologies Used
Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS (inline styling)

Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO (client and server)

Backend: Node.js (assumed server running at localhost:3001)

Core Features
Username Registration:
On launch, users are prompted to enter a username. This username is stored locally in state and displayed in the chat as the message author. The username also determines message alignment (left or right).

Real-Time Messaging:
Messages are sent and received in real-time using Socket.IO events (send_message, receive_message). This ensures seamless communication across all connected clients.

Auto Scroll:
When a new message arrives, the chat window automatically scrolls to the latest message, ensuring users don’t miss new content.

Chat UI Design:
Messages from the current user appear on the right with a green background, while incoming messages appear on the left with a gray bubble. Each message shows the sender’s name, time, and an avatar based on the first letter of the username.

Responsive Layout:
The layout adjusts to different screen sizes and offers an intuitive mobile experience, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Design & Styling Highlights
Uses inline styles with React components for a modular and scoped approach.

Rounded message bubbles for a modern, messenger-like UI.

Avatars are dynamically generated using the first character of the sender’s name.

A clean login interface styled with a light theme and shadowed box.

The main chat area has a sticky header, scrollable message area, and persistent input bar.

Learning & Concepts Covered
This project is a practical implementation of key real-time web development concepts:

WebSockets with Socket.IO: Handling low-latency, persistent client-server communication.

React Hooks: Managing component state (useState), side effects (useEffect), and DOM refs (useRef).

Event-driven Programming: Listening and emitting custom socket events.

UI/UX Design: Designing a chat interface that mirrors real-world messaging apps.

Project Outcome
The final product is a functional and visually clean chat application capable of handling multiple users simultaneously with smooth interaction. It provides a strong foundation for more advanced features such as:

Private messaging

Typing indicators

User list tracking

Message persistence with databases

Authentication and deployment

Conclusion
This project effectively demonstrates a strong grasp of real-time web development, frontend design, and event-based communication. It can serve as both a valuable learning milestone and a portfolio-worthy application for internships, job applications, or personal projects.
